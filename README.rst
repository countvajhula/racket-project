=========
This is a template for a Racket project and includes:

* CI config using GitHub Actions
* Running automated tests
* Coverage reporting using `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/>`_
* A Makefile for managing your project workflows using simple command line aliases
* A pull request template containing placeholder text that contributors will see when making pull requests against your repo

There are many other options you might need -- for instance, running tests for individual modules instead of everything, continous performance benchmarking via CI, and lots more that you might need depending on the nature of your project -- all of these are possible, but they are not included in the current template. If you need something that isn't here, please submit an issue or PR.

Replace the above with a description of your project. General signposting about your project follows.

Install it from the `Racket Package Index <https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/<project>>`_.
Read `the documentation <https://docs.racket-lang.org/<project>/index.html>`_ to learn more. See `the Wiki <https://github.com/<username>/<project>/wiki>`_ for community resources and events.

(If you'd prefer to opt into copyright and use a license, then replace the COPYING file with a LICENSE file containing your preferred license, update the pull request template in pull_request_template.md (but read it first, at least, so you can make an informed choice), and remove the above dedication.)
